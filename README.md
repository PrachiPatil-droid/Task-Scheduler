# Task-Scheduler
This is a Task Scheduler web app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps to quickly add, organize, and track tasks in a simple and clean interface. It is easy to use and visually neat, so managing tasks feels smooth. While building it, I also practiced DSA concepts, applying them to efficiently manage tasks.
